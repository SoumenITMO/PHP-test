   by command line to copy full database to a new one. In this case tables and their 
   relation and columns all will remain same. Yes, for security purpose it will need to 
   assign new credential for the database. But copy tables row by row using a script 
   definitely not convenient at all. First coping using script will be really slow and 
   not only that it will waste system resource. 
   
   copying by script is ok only if the table is small and does not have relation with other 
   tables. So, copying database using command-line is highly recommended.
