  For custom product it should have a table of custom products which can hold all custom products 
  and those custom products' data also should store and linked with other properties table where 
  it will hold custom products' properties data and separate logic needs to implements according 
  custom product requirement. So, when custom product will add then if custom product already exists.
  In case if it is not. Then special logic needs to implement where custom product will be added with 
  other data without having separate table for it's data and so on. The existing product logic needs 
  to modify when a custom product needs to add and apply custom logic for the custom product. But definitely
  if different custom product logic and properties are too much different then each custom product logic needs
  to design for the product.
